       <b>I think that words sums up all that you would feel. My first speech competition was in 4th and I had memorized what I had to say and I remember where I exactly stood it was first. Though what I do remember is how I could not make out if the microphone was receiving my voice properly. I did not know if I was talking clearly. I thought I was talking too fast (as was confirmed by my political science teacher later on). What I do remember is how after I finished and said my winding up argument, my voice continued to stay in a slightly higher pitch (out of nervousness I guess) but at the same time, I wanted to go back and do a better job. I honestly think that's what got me started off.Ever since then be it school or collegiate debates I have always put my name forward. I finished in the top three in most in few I didn't but ever since then each time I have gone up and addressed a different gathering of faces I have always primarily faced that same emotion that hit me that very first time.</b>
